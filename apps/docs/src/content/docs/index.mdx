## Inspired by .NET Solutions

Stack is an attempt to create a predictable opinionated software system. It can create backends, frontends,
desktop apps, mobile apps, CLI apps and reusable packages that they can share. Stack comes fully ejected — you
always own your build and configuration. Stack helps scaffold and link packages!

## WIP
- Not all environments are supported yet.

## 🛠 Supported Toolset

Stack comes pre-configured with a modern, high-performance stack so you can focus on code, not config.

<CardGrid staggered>
  <Card title="Build with tsup" icon="setting">
    All packages are bundled using `tsup`, powered by esbuild for blazing fast compilation.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Test with Vitest" icon="rocket">
    Unit testing is pre-configured out of the box with `vitest` for every new package.
  </Card>

  <Card title="React & Vite" icon="list-format">
    Generate shared React component libraries or full-stack Vite frontend applications instantly.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Backend & CLI" icon="add-document">
    Native support for **Fastify** APIs and robust CLI tools powered by **Commander**.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## ⚡ Quick Start

Follow these steps to get your first Stack workspace up and running in minutes.

<Steps>
1. Install the CLI

Manage your workspace by installing the global runner:

```bash
npm install -g @stack-dev/cli
```

2. Create a New Workspace

Scaffold your entire monorepo structure:

```bash
stack create my-new-project
```

3. Generate Your First Package

```bash
# Create a shared utility library
stack g my-utils --type library
```

4. Generate Your First App

```bash
# Create a vite React app
stack g frontend --type vite
```

5. Link to Your Package

```bash
cd apps/frontend

stack l @my-new-project/my-utils
```
</Steps>

## 🏗 Supported Project Types

Use `stack g <name> --type <type>` to generate different architecture patterns:

| Type     | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Library  | Vanilla TypeScript package with tsup & vitest |
| React   | Component libraries with optional Styled Components support |
| Vite    | Full React frontend static applications |
| Fastify | High-performance Node.js backend API scaffolding |
| CLI     | Command-line applications powered by Commander |

---

## 🛠 CLI Commands Reference

| Command | Alias | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `stack create <name>` | — | Initialize a new workspace |
| `stack g <name>` | — | Generate a new package (Library, React, Vite, Fastify, or CLI) |
| `stack link [name]` | `l` | Link a local workspace package |
| `stack unlink [name]` | `u` | Remove a local package link |

## 🔧 Development Workflow

Stack leverages **pnpm workspaces** for maximum efficiency.

### Project Structure

- `packages/*` — Shared libraries and configuration packages
- `apps/*` — Deployment targets (Vite apps, Fastify APIs, CLIs)
- `tooling/*` — Shared ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configs

### Common Scripts

```bash
# Build the entire workspace
pnpm run build

# Run in watch mode for development
pnpm run build --watch

# Smart link a package as a devDependency
stack link @stack-dev/core --dev
